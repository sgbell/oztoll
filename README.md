oztoll
============
This app was written as a toll calculator for toll roads in Melbourne, with the ability to add tolls for anywhere else.

It can download updated tolls from a website (url removed, as it is no longer active).

I hope that you find this code useful.


To compile the app you will need the following libraries:
ActionBarSherlock - version 4.4.0 : http://actionbarsherlock.com/
Google Play Services Lib

Google Maps part of the app will require your own api key, which can be set in the AndroidManifest.xml
