Thoughts and Notes for OzToll
=============================

1. Was going to use Google Maps api to allow the user to mark on the map where
	they were planning on driving on the toll roads, to calculate price. Google Maps api
	does not allow us to mark a road easily. I'd have to plot it myself. Also looked at other
	map offerings.
2. Might be easier to just create our own map/track, and allow the user to plot their course,
	to calculate their toll price.
3. After creating the correct sql statement to grab the toll information from the 3 tables,
	I just realized, I need to included more then 1 type of toll. 
	ie (car, car-weekend, car-single-zone, light truck, truck, truck night, motocycle, taxi)
4. After a Talk with Colin Adland, I've changed from using sqlite to xml files for the data.
