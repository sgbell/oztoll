Thoughts and Notes for OzToll
=============================

1. Was going to use Google Maps api to allow the user to mark on the map where
	they were planning on driving on the toll roads, to calculate price. Google Maps api
	does not allow us to mark a road easily. I'd have to plot it myself. Also looked at other
	map offerings.
2. Might be easier to just create our own map/track, and allow the user to plot their course,
	to calculate their toll price.
3. After creating the correct sql statement to grab the toll information from the 3 tables,
	I just realized, I need to included more then 1 type of toll. 
	ie (car, car-weekend, car-single-zone, light truck, truck, truck night, motocycle, taxi)
4. After a Talk with Colin Adland, I've changed from using sqlite to xml files for the data.
5. Making Toll Information in the xml file seperate for each tollway, with a seperate setting
	in the xml file for roads to join the tollways with. Maybe later we'll allow multiple entry
	and exits.
6. Talking with Theresa, changing the layout of the text for the road names to make it more readable.
	Roads running horizontally will have their names written vertically.
7. Need to trace the paths when points are selected, to make sure lines only go through roads leading
	to the exit point, and not through roads that are off the path.
